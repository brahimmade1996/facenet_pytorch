# Face Recognition Using Pytorch 

This is a repository for Inception Resnet (V1) models in pytorch, pretrained on VGGFace2 and CASIA-Webface.

Pytorch model weights were initialized using parameters ported from David Sandberg's [tensorflow facenet repo](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).

Also included in this repo is an efficient pytorch implementation of MTCNN for face detection prior to inference. These models are also pretrained.
